<p>While youâ€™re free to use your own editor, this codelab will probably be easier to follow if you use the WebStorm IDE. If you don't have it installed yet, you can download from official website.</p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=windows-version" target="_blank"><paper-button raised="" class="colored"><iron-icon icon="file-download"></iron-icon>Download WebStorm</paper-button></a><p>After installing the WebStorm, use it to clone a Git repo (or just use the terminal).</p><p><strong>Fetching the components may take some time if your internet connection is slow</strong>.</p><p>When the installation finishes, your project folder should look something like this:</p><h3>Further installation:</h3><ul><li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Node.js</a></li><li>Install <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a> and <a href="" target="_blank">Bower</a> globally</li></ul><pre class="indented">

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.</p></aside><aside class="special"><p><strong>What is Gulp?</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>&nbsp; is a task/build runner for development. It allows you to do a lot of stuff within your development workflow. You can compile sass files, uglify and compress js files and much more. The kicker for gulp is that its a streaming build system which doesn't write temp files. It's like Pipes in bash.</p></aside><aside class="special"><p><strong>What is Bower?</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>&nbsp;is a client-side package management tool that you can use with any web app to take care of the hassles of dependency management. Every Polymer component defines its own set of dependencies. When you install a Polymer component using Bower, the component and its dependencies are installed under <code>bower_components/</code>.</p></aside><h2>Run the demo</h2><p>Next command should open the demo in a new browser tab:</p><pre class="indented">
